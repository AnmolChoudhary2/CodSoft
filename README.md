This repository contains three machine learning projects exploring different domains and prediction tasks:

**1. Titanic Survival Prediction**

* **Goal:** Predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would have survived based on various features (age, gender, class, etc.).
* **Dataset:**  The Titanic dataset, containing passenger information and survival outcomes.
* **Approach:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in the data and build a predictive model.
* **Key Points:**
    * Data preprocessing and exploration are crucial for understanding the relationships between features.
    * Feature engineering may involve creating new features (e.g., family size) to improve model performance.
    * Model selection, training, and evaluation are essential for identifying the best-performing algorithm.

**2. Iris Flower Classification**

* **Goal:** Classify iris flowers into their respective species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on measurements of their sepals and petals.
* **Dataset:** The Iris flower dataset, a classic and widely used dataset in machine learning.
* **Approach:** Employ machine learning algorithms to learn the characteristics of each species and build a classification model.
* **Key Points:**
    * This project is a great starting point for beginners in machine learning due to the dataset's simplicity.
    * It illustrates the concepts of feature selection, model training, and model evaluation.

**3. Movie Rating Prediction**

* **Goal:** Predict the rating a user would give to a movie based on their preferences and movie attributes.
* **Dataset:** A movie ratings dataset containing user ratings for various movies, along with movie features (genre, actors, director, etc.).
* **Approach:** Develop a recommendation system or a regression model to predict movie ratings.
* **Key Points:**
    * This project involves techniques like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
    * It can be extended to include additional features like user demographics and movie reviews.

**How to Use This Repository**
